# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Python
This project will help you see - What do people on Twitter think about any topic of your choice

There are three steps in this project:

### Step 1 - Get the tweets
  Authorize and get the tweets from the Twitter API using tweepy package.
  
  Save the tweets obtained in a dataframe using panda package.
  
### Step 2 - Preprocess the tweets
  
   Using the preprocessor package makes the cleaning process easier. It removes the urls and unnecessary data. 
   
   Next, remove the stop words. import remove_stopwords package and remove the stop words from the data frame.

### Step 3 - Perform Sentiment Analysis
  
  Perform Sentiment Analysis using the TextBlob package and find out the average polarity of the dataframe. 
  
  Then display the results in a piechart.
  
  Make a word cloud of the data frame using the package wordcloud.
  
  The output shows two plots - one with the sentiment analyis piechart and the other with the wordcloud.
